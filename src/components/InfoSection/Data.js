    description: 'Hey there! We are Juan of a Kind! A food truck started by the primo-hermano duo, Juan and Daniel, with the goal to provide delicious food to our customers while giving back to our community. Growing up together, Juan and I have always been more like brothers than cousins, as such, we hold similar values and beliefs which made starting Juan Of A Kind a no brainer. In order to help give back to the communities that helped to make us who we are, we will be implementing various programs into our business to help give back such as “Pay It Forward” which will allow people to pay for someone’s meal at a later time and “Hungry Heauxs” which will provide meals to people who really need it. Every time you purchase anything on the menu, a certain percentage will go towards making these programs successful. That means every time you eat a taco with us, someone else enjoys one too. Let’s face it, tacos make the world go round. We aim at providing a down to earth vibe, while taking you to the skies with our product.',
